# cv

This repository automates the generation of a latex CV.

The CV template was inspired by [latex-ninja/simple-hipstercv](https://github.com/latex-ninja/simple-hipstercv/).

The content of the different sections is separated in folders to be easily updated.

An action runs on each PR to build the pdf, which becomes a release when merged on the main branch.
